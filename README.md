# Automated Workflow Generator
Tools for No/Low Code Workflow Automations

# Tools
- Generate Skeleton Workflows + Docs from Meeting Transcript
- Manage Workflow's Credentials (useful when migrating from sandbox to production)
- Move from one platform to another (ex: Zapier -> n8n)

# Background
At first I wanted to generate fully baked workflows. That was hard. I'm now thinking that building tools for the most tedious tasks of workflow automation is the way to go!
